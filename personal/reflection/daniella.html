                    <p>This team project was definitely an adventure at most. It was great practice to put everything that we have learned throughout the course all in one simple project. Along the way there were some complications with servers not being able to work but as a team we ended up figuring everything out. As a team I believe we worked pretty well. Darian has been a great help towards my part of the project, the project page. He has helped with put it together and asnwered any questions I had as well. I am overall not the best with CSS designing and pages so some of these assignments have been hard for me to do. Gene has been a great help explaining the lectures and meeting up with him has really helped me clear my confusion of CSS. This class has been a great experience and I will take what I have learned and apply it to web designing in the future.</p>
