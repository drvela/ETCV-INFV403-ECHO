                <div class="entry">
                    <p>Being part of the Echo team was very helpful. All all the group members helped each other making this the best part of the project. Everyone was so patient with each other, specially since all of us come from different career paths. All of us had different skills to contribute to team. It was a good hands on experience that I really enjoyed. It helped me practice everything we learned in class with a bit of more liberty.</p> 
                    <p>On an individual basis, I had hoped to work more on the css part of the project since this is the part I had most difficulty with throughout the course as well as the responsive page setup. Using the new server was also somewhat difficult since organization of the folders made the source paths difficult to understand and rearrange.</p>
                    <p>Overall, I learned immensely and hope to continue with more similar courses. I really enjoyed this course and this exciting project. I thank all the team members for helping, especially Darian for helping me.</p>
