                <div class="entry">
                    <p>This was a fun project because we had a lot of freedom to flex our web design skills. That being said it was also a little intimidating because although we learned how to make a website, we didn't necessarily learn how to make the most cutting-edge looking site, which is what everyone is used to and kind of expects when it comes to web design.</p>
                    <p>It would've been nice to have started the final project a bit earlier, or maybe know who is on our team in advance. Starting so near finals and right after Thanksgiving everyone was busy. My team didn't actually have a chance to get together in person and I think that would've helped the process a lot. The server issues slowed us down as well, so maybe in the future it would be nice to give a lesson on the server we'll use for finals or Github or just an overview of services people can use to actually get a website deployed. No web design class has actually ever taught me that.</p>
                    <p>I wish we had more time to tweak the project and make it function and look better, but overall I think it came out pretty well! I mainly worked on the home page and CSS for the site, and at the last minute created a backup table for responsive design, which was really tricky to get working.
