                <div class="entry">
                    <p>Overall the group project assignment for me was a great learning experience. Even though some personal issues back at home held me from participating throughout the week, I was still able to step-in and provide help by putting together a preview page for the team to see how the links worked in every page. The Echo team did an amazing job getting this site together, the only thing that I wish could have not happened was the issue with the server, new additions were not being updated upon uploading any files. </p>
                    <p>In addition, this project proved to be a great academic (and real world) learning experience by presenting issues web designing companies have deal with on a daily basis with clients, team members, and other businesses. Although this was a fictitious company, the Echo team dealt with team members with different programming skills, a wide range of ideas and business perspectives, marketing strategies, and technical issues. In general, the Echo team teamed up and created a great website.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, the Echo team website could not have been achieve without the time and effort committed to the success of this site. A special thanks to Darian, who I believe was the central piece of getting together this project and also by helping guide me upon my late arrival to this project. </p>
